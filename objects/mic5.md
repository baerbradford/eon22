# MIC 5

*Mentor-Instructor-Counselor Series 5*

Sol Industries Mentor-Instructor-Counselor Series 5, often called MIC 5, was a robot produced in small quantities for the functions of mentoring, instructing, and counseling children. This series of machine was manufactured exclusively during the years [2100-2104](/events/timeline#2100s) within [Crisium](/locations/crisium). The robots purported advanced artificial intelligence capabilities far beyond most machines of the time period, but this was achieved through the use of a dedicated team of employees. Working in shifts and entirely abstracted from the end user of the machine, the combined efforts enabled the robot to be more human-like and nuturing than any previous model. The use of humans in this manner created ethical controversy which caused the MIC program to ultimately and abrubtly be ended in 2104. All robots of this series made available through limited lease-only agreement and were repossessed by Sol. The repossessed units are presumed to have been deactivated, crushed, and recycled.
