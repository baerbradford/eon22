# 2110s

Conflict between corporate and government interests finally come to a head and result in the nuclear destruction of the vast majority of Earth.
Corporations based on the moon are victorious; governments are a thing of history; the destitute and losers are left to deal with the (literal) fallout of humanityâ€™s greatest war.

Belonging to no faction or too horrified with the disasters witnesses in their lifetime, a small sect of people flee to the Martian frontier under the leadership of Lila Peres (Israeli heir to Sol Industries) and Charles Storm (American born, corporate fighter, revered Martian founder, deeply involved in all factions).
Here, they develop what is intended to be a peaceful and isolated society.
